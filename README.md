# Getting-Cleaning-Data Week 4 project

This is a reposatory created for Coursera's week 4 project, "Getting and Cleaning Data." This includes the run_analysis, tidy_data, and the codebook for this assignment. 

# Files:
Codebook.md describes the how to use the code, variables, the data, and any transformations that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains the code used to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps below and within the code. Here are the five steps:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

tidy_data.txt is the output of the final step
